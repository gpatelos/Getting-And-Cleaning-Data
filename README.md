# Background 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to below represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

# Introduction

This project is an example of cleaning and working with a dataset. 

run_analysis.R should be run from within the same directory as the unzipped data (can be downloaded below) which will output a tidydata.txt

The source data contains the following files relevant to this analysis. (Additional raw data is available in subfolders of test and train for further analysis, though will not be used for our purposes)

### Descriptive data of the features, subjects and activities.
activity_labels.txt
features.txt
features_info.txt

### Collected data and associated identifiers
test/X_test.txt
test/y_test.txt
test/subject_test.txt
train/X_train.txt
train/y_train.txt
train/subject_train.txt
